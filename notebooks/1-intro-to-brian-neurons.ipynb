However, for quantities with physical dimensions it is incorrect because the results would change depending on the unit you measured it in.

On its own, this only means that the neuron cannot spike in this period (see below), but doesn't change how ``v`` behaves. In order to make ``v`` stay constant during the refractory period, we have to add ``(unless refractory)`` to the end of the definition of ``v`` in the differential equations.

Since the refractory period is now 15 ms this means that the neuron won't be able to spike again until time 8 + 15 = 23 ms. Immediately after the first spike, the value of ``v`` now instantly starts to rise because we didn't specify ``(unless refractory)`` in the definition of ``dv/dt``. However, once it reaches the value 0.8 (the dashed green line) at time roughly 8 ms it doesn't fire a spike even though the threshold is ``v>0.8``. This is because the neuron is still refractory until time 23 ms, at which point it fires a spike.\n",
